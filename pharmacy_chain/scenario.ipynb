    "# Pharmacy Chain Discrete Event Simulation\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "### Intro\n",
    "The Pharmacy Chain has `N` pharmacies scattered in 2 areas:\n",
    "1. City Center\n",
    "2. City Periphery\n",
    "3. Rural\n",
    "\n",
    "All locations share the same Warehouse, which in this simulation has an \"infinite\" amount of medication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Medication Types\n",
    "All the medication is separated into 2 main categories: *OTC* (Over the Counter) and *Prescription* medication.\n",
    "\n",
    "OTC Medication used in this simulation:\n",
    "- Ibuprofen (painkiller, antipyretic)\n",
    "- Paracetamol (painkiller, antipyretic)\n",
    "- Vitamin C (flu and general wellness)\n",
    "- Vitamin D (wellness)\n",
    "- Zinc (wellness)\n",
    "- Calcium carbonate (reflux)\n",
    "- Benzydamine (sore throat)\n",
    "- Amylmetacresol (sore throat)\n",
    "- Loperamide (antidiarrheal)\n",
    "- Oxymetazoline (decongestant)\n",
    "\n",
    "Prescription medication:\n",
    "- Amoxicillin (antibiotic)\n",
    "- Enalapril (cardio-vascular)\n",
    "- Metformin (diabetes)\n",
    "- Escitalopram (psychiatric)\n",
    "- Alprazolam (psychiatric)\n",
    "- Tramadol (prescription painkiller) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Customer Personas\n",
    "Customers are generated with different \"personas\". This affects the probabilities of the medication they will want to buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quick-Fixer**: only buys 1-2 OTCs for a certain cause. Easily accepts alternatives. Low-Medium patience.\n",
    "- **Wellness Customer**: buys vitamins. High patience.\n",
    "- **Acute Flu Patient**: buys OTCs and/or prescription medication for colds and flus.\n",
    "- **Senior**: chroinic patient that gets the same medication.\n",
    "- **Depressive**: chronic patient. Buys psychiatric medication and sometimes vitamins.\n",
    "- **Post-Op Patient**: rare. Buys antibiotics and serios painkillers.\n",
    "- **Stockpiler**: buys many OTCs at once, for the whole family. \n",
    "- **Problem Patient**: somewhat rare. Arrives with expired prescriptions or no prescription. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Stock management.\n",
    "At the end of every work day, the stock is checked and if it is below a certain `threshold`, a restock from the warehouse is ordered for the next morning. The truck with the medication takes some time to arrive, based on the area the pharmacy is in.\n",
    "\n",
